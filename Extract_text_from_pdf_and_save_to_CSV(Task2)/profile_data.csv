The project was on digital warehousing of data across the regions in United states. The client was aiming at planning for it’s budget allocation for the upcoming Financial Year. The problem statement in here was to unearth insights from the digital data provided so that it study the current year performance across regions and then use those insights for budget allocation for digital marketing strategy through various online channels for the next year.   The Key metrics that were worked upon from the data were Clicks, Impression, Click Through Ratio (CTR), Bounce Rate, Cost Per Click, Impression Duration. To Further analyze the consumer behavior the other metrics worked upon were Consumer ID, Location, Transaction amount, Product ID, Product Category etc. The conclusions were that most of the product that engaged consumers were from online channels and Paid Searches were the most effective among them Followed by Earned channels and then owned channels. In traditional Media TV was more effective then Print. The budget allocation for the next Financial Year was assigned with major portion to Online Channels and Furthermore into Paid searches.   The region wise segmentation concluded that the Spanish speaking population residing in the Southern states of U.S. were more in numbers as buyers hence the ads and impressions on TV were to be more in Spanish.         The shift from traditional to Online media helped in reducing the cost by 40%.

Instead, Top Skills I have long connected with my kids & other people through ideas. When my daughter struggled with confidence, we listened to Amy Project Management Cuddy’s TED talk on body language. When a co-worker struggled Public Speaking with small talk, we listened to Kalina Silverman’s TED talk on big Customer Service talk. Certifications So, I applied for and was granted a license to host a TEDx event working towards Project Manager Professional certification where I connect people and ideas by organizing and coaching Certificate of Achievement in Project speakers with ideas worth sharing. Most TEDx events have teams of Management volunteers. The first year, our team was just my teenage daughter, her best friend and myself organizing, implementing and executing plans while managing risk. I created a partnership to produce TEDxGilbert with Gilbert Talks, a local non-profit dedicated to improving our community through dialogue and am now a member of their board. I connected my interests of travel & service as the Executive Director for Hope Arising, an international NGO by coordinating medical & volunteer teams to go to Ethiopia to provide free health clinics. Even though I’m no longer ED, I still lead these trips and volunteer because I’m so committed to our mission there. We run a micro-loan program to get the poorest women to self-reliance. This led me to work with Joe Shurtz, owner of Sure Spark Marketing who came on a trip and liked my combination of having an analytical brain while still communicating well with people so he hired me to be a Project Manager. While there, I enjoyed collaborating with a range of clients on implementing new websites, overhauling their marketing strategies with data-driven results, & planned events, all while staying within the scope of their projects.     Page 1 of 4     In addition to managing TEDxGilbert, I am also the project manager at Engagement Learning, a small publishing company for niche college & high school textbooks. I created the comic book section of our Model UN textbook.  As a PacMan-esque Project Manager, I gobble up to-do items like PacMan gobbles yellow circles. I am tenacious at solving problems, which often aren't fixed by the first solution...or the second. I just keep trying and am not daunted. I am interested in many different ideas & areas. As I took coding, web development, Photoshop, photography and computer classes, I wondered why I couldn’t pinpoint a specialty. I realized that I love being a generalist & author David Epstein taught me that it’s a superpower! Please feel free to connect, either about career opportunities or TEDxGilbert.

During my research for Artırılmış Gerçeklik - 2 my dissertation, I have seen a lot of different use cases for VR and Build A Multiplayer Augmented Reality (AR) Game With Unity AR, naturally I want to apply these technologies to various industries, AgilePM® Foundation with ROG Studios. I hope that Turkish people will realize the power of VR and AR and Turkish companies and schools will invest in these technologies, just like the rest of the world. Our second step in reality technologies is, education. We aim to use augmented and virtual reality to educate young students, especially in these Covid-19 times. Students who are between 8-16 years old, do not enjoy online classes, because frankly, they're boring for kids (and for most of adults). However, when they start learning with AR using their phones, they will love learning and they won't forget what they learn, because they will learn by doing, not watching. Also, after they come back to school, when the virus situation eases off, we want schools to buy and use VR headsets in classes to teach them abstract concepts, because young children can't simply visualize 3D abstract things, but if they learn in VR, by interacting with 3D objects,   Page 1 of 3     then they won't forget what they learn. Because, in order to learn a 3D concept, you should learn it in a 3D environment, and I propose learning with VR and AR. Imagine teaching kids about animal cells... Would you rather teach this 3D subject using a 2D platform, such as a computer screen or a book, or would you rather ""be inside the cell"". So, our next objective is to educate young students with AR and VR. Of course, we want to expand this technology to high schools and universities too...
